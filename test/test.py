'''This test file is intended to test the database and the gui to a good extent.
This should:
  - create random entries with somewhat random timestamps.
  - Save entries to a text file for comparison.
  - Enter each entry into the database
  - search for some of the random terms.
  - Remove database after testing
  - Collect and show statistics throughout
  - Push buttons to see if there is a place where things break down.'''
